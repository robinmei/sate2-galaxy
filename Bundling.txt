Directions:

Install galaxy
Install sate_galaxy_dist in galaxy/tools
It should contain:
    Sate package
    Sate xml (in same directory as run_sate.py, usually sate-core)
Add path to sate.xml in tool_conf.xml
I think it's easier to extract sate to the tools folder instead of having it installed elsewhere on the system
    Has to do with path to dependencies, this installs them without having to modify .bash_rc
    Also if they've already got sate on their machine, what's the point of galaxy right
Installation
    Identical on Mac/Unix, working fine
    Windows will require cygwin (for run.sh)
    Haven't gotten all the dependencies on the Windows machine yet
